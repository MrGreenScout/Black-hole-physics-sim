#Project specification

1. Some background to the area/problem
2. Implementation specifics (as many as possible)
Technologies, physics problem, constraints
3. Specifics of what the final system will look like
and do (include sketches if you like)
4. References (2-3)
5. Potential risks/challenges
And how they might be avoided/minimized
6. Degree of simulation
To what degree will the simulation use existing physics
libraries versus being implemented from the ground up
7. Link to blog containing first blog entry
Hint: your specification and a representative image can be
your first blog entry
