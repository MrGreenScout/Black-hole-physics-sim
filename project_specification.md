Grade aim: A

## 1. Some background to the area/problem

### Introduction
  Black holes are a type of exotic celestial object, with the key feature being their extreme mass, so massive not even light can escape its pull. 
  This makes for a very interesting subject, since as we know, light has no mass, so how does something massive "bend" the path of the light? 
  Quite literally of course, bending space itself.
  
  The aim of this project is to visualize this bending of space-time close to a Schwarzschild black hole.

  Since the warping of space-time is not something we usually think about in everyday life it can be quite difficult to understand.
  And due to this when we start to learn about a foreign subject like this we want to draw parallells to those things we know. This causes many
  visualizations of similar character to simplify the subject too much, such as reducing the effects of a black hole, just describing it using 
  newtonian physics. Some may state that they simulate photons when actually simulating particles with mass. This is wrong and part of this 
  project's aim is to improve upon these lacking visualizations. A Key take-away from this visualization should be that gravity does not act 
  like a force, it is instead a part of the geometry of space-time. Gravity does not effect photons, it effects the space the photons travel
  through, warping it.

## Background
  There are many physics and maths concepts neeeded to model an accurate black hole visualization.

  Key concepts:
  - (Parts of) general theory of relativity
  - Schwartzchild metric
  - Geodesic equation (in the context of general relativity)
  - Weak Field Limit

## 2. Implementation specifics (as many as possible)
Technologies, physics problem, constraints

  The project will be made using the unity game engine. First a 2D version will be made to keep the scope of the project down, then if
  there's time for it, it may be expanded to 3D. S 
  
  The Black hole representation
  - Defining the Schwarzschild Radius
  Warping space
  - Solving Geodesics equations

## 3. Specifics of what the final system will look like
and do (include sketches if you like)
## 4. References (2-3)

## 5. Potential risks/challenges (And how they might be avoided/minimized)


## 6. Degree of simulation
To what degree will the simulation use existing physics
libraries versus being implemented from the ground up

  The majority of the physics will be made from the ground up.
